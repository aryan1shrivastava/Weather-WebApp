## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Structure of the web pages
- **CSS3** - Styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** - Dynamic functionality
- **OpenWeatherMap API** - For weather data
- **Service Worker** - For offline capabilities
- **PWA Manifest** - To make the app installable

## 🧠 How it Works

- The app fetches your current location (with permission) and displays weather data using the **OpenWeatherMap API**.
- You can also search for any city manually to view its weather.
- A **Service Worker** caches assets (HTML, CSS, JS, icons) during the first load, making the app available offline.
- The **Web App Manifest** allows the app to be installed on a mobile device or desktop.
